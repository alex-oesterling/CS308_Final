### Running the Program

Main class: 
Main.java

Data files needed: 
- The data files are provided in the resources folder. The user is free to add their own files assuming
they follow the correct format. If the format is incorrect, default values are used. 
- For example, the data for Mario is in the resources/mario folder. 


Features implemented:
- Save Game: Can save a current game by pressing X
- Load Game: Can load a new game by pressing load game on the title screen 
- GamePad use: Player 2 can use a controller if they wish 
- Extra games: support additional games past the 3 original (Mario, RivalRacer, FlappyBird) like Doodle Jump, 
    Monster Dash and Smash
- Local multiplayer
- Artificial players
- Preferences (music switching and volume changing) 


### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:
- Our biggest assumption is that the data files that are input into the system are not corrupt. We have implemented exception handling by
using default values when this occurs. 
- We also have no win screen currently. There is a loss screen but adding a win screen would require the addition of a WinLevel action 
that is called when a certain brick is passed. This WinLevel action would trigger the win screen. 

Interesting data files:
- Our most developed game is Mario. The data files to play this game are located in the resources/mario folder. 

Known Bugs:
- Flappy Bird: holding space down makes Flappy float forever
- Using attack in Smash in the same frame as the previous attach causes the player to disappear  

Extra credit:
- GamePad
- Controller Config

### Impressions
Though it was hard work, our team really enjoyed the process of creating a game from scratch. We were able to create basic implementations
of famous games despite our still developing knowledge and skills.
