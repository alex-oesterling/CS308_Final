Use Case 2: The User selects a Game from the Game Select Screen

1. The GameCabinet class passes the currently selected game (as a String) into the
Model and View Controller classes (called ModelController and ViewController).

    within GameCabinet:

    sendGame(String selectedGame) {
        return selectedGame;
    }

2. Then, the MainController will call the method
 setUpGameModel() from the ModelController class (that extends the ModelExternalAPI) to set up the back end side.

    within MainController:

    myModelController.setUpGameModel(GameCabinet.sendGame);

3. The ViewController calls the method setUpViewModel from the ViewController class (that implements the ViewExternalAPI)
to set up the front end

    within MainController:

    myViewController.setUpGameView(GameCabinet.sendGame);
