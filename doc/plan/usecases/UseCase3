Use Case 3: The User selects 2-Players in the Gameâ€™s title screen

1. The ModelController class instantiates two Avatar objects using the Player API method called createPlayer().

    within ModelController:

    this.createPlayer();

2. The second Avatar object is instantiated with the Player2.xml file to have the appropriate keybinds, again using the
createPlayer() method.

  within Player implementation classes:

   void createPlayer(String type) {
        ResourceBundle playerBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("final_team15.doc.data.Mario");
        this.ID = playerBundle.getString("ID");
        this.height = playerBundle.getString("Height");
        /**
        * Read rest of data file
        */
   }
