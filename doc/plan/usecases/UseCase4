Use Case 4: The User goes Home from a current game by pressing “H”

1. KeyBinds class receives the keyboard input of “H” from the ModelController using
the implemented sendUserData() method.
    within ModelController:

    sendUserData() {
        return data;
    }

2. The GameLibrary class’s goHome() method is invoked within the MainController class.
3. The MainController tells the ViewController to switch scenes to display the GameSelect screen
 over the game. This will happen by calling the implemented setUpGameView() (with input
 parameter as the default screen) to display the Game Select screen over the game.

    within MainController:

    myViewController.setUpGameView(GameCabinet.sendGame);
